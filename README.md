# InceptionV3 Model in Azure AI Gallery

## Intro
This repository contains code which demonstrates how to deploy and use an Inception model in Azure Machine Learning.

## How to Use
1. Use [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/Azure-Samples/AI-Gallery-InceptionV3) to [import the sample notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/Azure-Samples/AI-Gallery-InceptionV3) into Azure Notebooks.
2. Run the [configuration notebook](00.configuration.ipynb) to create your workspace. 
3. Run the [01.deploy-inception-model notebook](01.deploy-inception-model.ipynb) to deploy inception v3 model to a web service and try out for inference.
